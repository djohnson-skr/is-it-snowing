# is-it-snowing
This is a simple python script that uses a weather api to check if it will snow today. If it will be snowing, an email will be sent to any subscriber. This was made to highlight pythons simplicity of use and how to access data via an api.
This code is heavily commented and designed to show the power of python
As an added bonus, you can automate this script with task manager or a cron job so that it will run on a set schedule.
